    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you've never heard of shotgun shells as a food, then you're so lucky you stopped by today. Because it's sooooo good! I've been making shotgun shells for a little while now. 
        They make the perfect appetizer for any occasion, and I've even been known to serve them as a fun meal for special days like birthdays or homecomings. 
        It's one of those recipes that has a name that leaves people scratching their heads and a flavor that always has them coming back fo more. 
        It's perfect for any party or get-together, and it's so easy to make, you'll be eager to churn out these tasty, bacon wrapped bites. </p>

    <p>These baked shotgun shells are an out of this world appetizer - pasta shells are stuffed with ground sirloin and cheese, wrapped in bacon, and baked until crispy.
        It's a hearty, delicious appetizer recipe that everyone loves, and it goes quickly when served.
        It's oven baked which is great for those who don't own a smoker. </p>

        <li>Combine ground sirloin, Italian sausage, onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cheese, and cream cheese in a bowl.

        <li>Fill each pasta shell evenly with the filling and wrap each filled shell with bacon. 
            Place shells on a lightly greased rack set inside a baking sheet and brush evenly with barbecue sauce. </li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, flip each shell, and brush again with barbecue sauce. </li>

        <li>Return to the oven and bake until deep golden brown and the bacon is slightly crispy, 25 to 30 minutes more.
