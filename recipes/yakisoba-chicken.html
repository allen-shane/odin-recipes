    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yakisoba sauce is a sweet, savory, and tangy mix of soy sauce, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings. 
        Some yakisoba sauce recipes include oyster sauce, which has a more rich umami flavor. 
        I also added sriracha to my yakisoba sauce because I like things a little spicy! </p>

    <p>The addition of ketchup makes this sauce super tangy, and a splash of Worcestershire gives it a uniquely sweet-umami flavor.
        Japanese buckwheat flour noodles with chicken at their best! Noodles can be found in an Asian foods market. </p>

    <p>The wonderful thing about this recipe is that you can use just about any mix of vegetables that you have leftover in your fridge. 
        Just stay away from very watery vegetables, like tomatoes. 
        Also, to make life easier, you can replace the hand-shredded cabbage and carrots with a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chile paste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced lengthwise into eighths</li>
        <li>½ medium head cabbage, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>8 ounces soba noodles, cooked and drained</li>
    </ul>  

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet combine sesame oil, canola oil and chili paste; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add garlic and stir fry an additional 30 seconds. 
            Add chicken and 1/4 cup of the soy sauce and stir fry until chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove mixture from pan, set aside, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In the emptied pan combine the onion, cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry until cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Stir in the remaining soy sauce, cooked noodles, and the chicken mixture to pan and mix to blend. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
