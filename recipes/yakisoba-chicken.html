    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yakisoba sauce is a sweet, savory, and tangy mix of soy sauce, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings. 
        Some yakisoba sauce recipes include oyster sauce, which has a more rich umami flavor. 
        I also added sriracha to my yakisoba sauce because I like things a little spicy! </p>

    <p>The addition of ketchup makes this sauce super tangy, and a splash of Worcestershire gives it a uniquely sweet-umami flavor.
        Japanese buckwheat flour noodles with chicken at their best! Noodles can be found in an Asian foods market. </p>

    <p>The wonderful thing about this recipe is that you can use just about any mix of vegetables that you have leftover in your fridge. 
        Just stay away from very watery vegetables, like tomatoes. 
        Also, to make life easier, you can replace the hand-shredded cabbage and carrots with a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots).</p>
